### Problems with Javascript
1. No type checks in javascript.
2. parameters are treated as undefined if not passed.
3. javascript objects are loosely structures, no strict measures to avoid adding properties to objects

### How Typescript works?
Typescript code is transpiled into javascript code which the browser understands.

### Typescipt vs Javascript
1. Typescript = Javascript + Static types
2. Typescript is a superset of javascript i.e valid javascript is still valid typescript as well.
